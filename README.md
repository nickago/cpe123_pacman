# Pacman 2.0
A pacman implementation I created for my CPE 123 (Computational Art) class
freshman year.

Comes with all the cool features:
* Standard game play mode
* Realistic Pacman sounds
* Basic ghost AI to follow Pacman
* Level editor w/ ASCII save file
* Code written by a first quarter freshman with little prior coding experience

As per the commit notes, minor changes have been made to keep the code running
on Processing 3, however as little was changes as possible
(for better or worse).

# Installing
This code runs on [Processing](https://processing.org), a Java overlay that
allows for easy artistic coding. Download this enviornment and install it,
then open the `FinalProject.pde` file and click play.

# Contributing
Unfortunately, I will not be taking any PR's on this code as it is only up
here for sentimental and preservative value. Don't let that stop you from
making them however.
